# Security-Driven Cloud Acceleration (SDCA) Sample Code

This project provides CloudFormations and Terraform templates to more easily embed and automate core security services into any workload, program, accelerator or industry-specific solution. These templates are built upon the AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA) codebase, and provide a simplified way for customers to "shift-left" and automate with AWS native security services to provide a core defense-in-depth strategy.
